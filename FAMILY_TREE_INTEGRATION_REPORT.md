2. **Include Phase 2 integration script:**
   ```html
   <script type="module" src="/auntruth/new/js/phase2-integration.js"></script>
   ```

3. **Optionally include CSS files explicitly:**
   ```html
   <link href="/auntruth/new/css/family-tree.css" rel="stylesheet">
   <link href="/auntruth/new/css/enhanced-search.css" rel="stylesheet">
   <link href="/auntruth/new/css/information-disclosure.css" rel="stylesheet">
