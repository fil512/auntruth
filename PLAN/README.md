# AuntieRuth.com PLAN Directory

This directory contains shared documentation and patterns extracted from the individual PRP files to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.

## Shared Documentation Files

### Core Architecture
- **[site-architecture.md](site-architecture.md)** - Core site structure, data organization, lineage structure, and hosting constraints
- **[technical-requirements.md](technical-requirements.md)** - Browser support, performance requirements, accessibility standards, and technical constraints
- **[component-architecture.md](component-architecture.md)** - Base component patterns, integration patterns, and architectural guidelines

### Development Patterns
- **[component-integration-patterns.md](component-integration-patterns.md)** - Inter-component communication, data sharing, URL routing integration, and error handling patterns
- **[implementation-patterns.md](implementation-patterns.md)** - Development workflows, performance optimization, data processing, error handling, and monitoring patterns
- **[mobile-responsive-design.md](mobile-responsive-design.md)** - Mobile-first design principles, touch interaction patterns, responsive layouts, and accessibility considerations

### Quality Assurance
- **[testing-qa-standards.md](testing-qa-standards.md)** - Testing strategies, cross-browser requirements, performance testing, accessibility testing, and quality gates

## How to Use This Documentation

### For Individual PRPs
Each PRP file now references the relevant shared documentation with `Read ../PLAN/filename.md` directives instead of duplicating common information. This approach:

- **Reduces file size** - PRPs focus on their specific requirements
- **Ensures consistency** - Shared standards are defined once
- **Improves maintainability** - Updates to common patterns only need to be made in one place
- **Provides comprehensive context** - All architectural decisions and constraints are documented

### For Implementation Teams
1. **Start with the PLAN documentation** to understand the overall architecture and constraints
2. **Read specific PRP files** for detailed implementation requirements
3. **Reference shared patterns** during development to ensure consistency
4. **Update PLAN files** when architectural decisions change to maintain accuracy

## Benefits of This Approach

### Reduced Duplication
- Site architecture details appear once in `site-architecture.md` instead of in every PRP
- Technical requirements are centralized and consistently referenced
- Testing standards apply to all components without repetition

### Improved Consistency
- All components follow the same architectural patterns
- Browser support requirements are consistent across all PRPs
- Performance standards are applied uniformly

### Better Maintainability
- Architecture changes only need to be updated in PLAN files
- New requirements can be added to shared documentation
- Individual PRPs remain focused on their specific scope

### Enhanced Collaboration
- Developers can quickly understand the overall system architecture
- Design decisions are documented and easily referenced
- Quality standards are clear and comprehensive

This structure transforms the PRP collection from individual documents into a cohesive system architecture with specific implementation guidelines.
