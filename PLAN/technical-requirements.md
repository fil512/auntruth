# Technical Requirements & Constraints

## Core Technical Principles

### Progressive Enhancement
- **Site must work without JavaScript** - Core functionality accessible with HTML/CSS only
- **JavaScript enhancement only** - All JavaScript features are enhancements to working base functionality
- **Graceful degradation** - Advanced features degrade gracefully on older browsers
- **No breaking changes** - Enhancements cannot break existing functionality

### Browser Support Requirements
- **Modern Browsers:** Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13+, Edge 80+
- **Mobile Browsers:** iOS Safari 13+, Chrome Mobile 80+, Samsung Internet 12+
- **Legacy Fallback:** Basic functionality in older browsers
- **Progressive Web App** capabilities where applicable

### Performance Requirements
- **Page Load Times:**
  - Initial page load: < 2 seconds on 3G connection
  - Component initialization: < 500ms
  - Interactive response: < 100ms for user actions
- **Memory Usage:**
  - Efficient for mobile device memory constraints
  - No memory leaks during extended browsing sessions
- **Mobile Performance:**
  - Smooth interactions on mid-range mobile devices
  - 60fps scrolling and animations

### Touch & Mobile Requirements
- **Touch Targets:** All interactive elements minimum 44px (WCAG guidelines)
- **Touch Gestures:** Support for standard mobile gestures where appropriate
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with desktop enhancements
- **Offline Capability:** Basic functionality available without internet connection

## Development Constraints

### Legacy Compatibility
- **No HTML Modification:** Cannot modify existing 11,120+ genealogy HTML files
- **URL Preservation:** All existing URLs must continue working indefinitely
- **Data Structure:** Must work with existing `js/data.json` without breaking changes
- **CSS Compatibility:** Cannot break existing styling and layout

### GitHub Pages Constraints
- **Static Site Hosting:** No server-side processing available
- **Build Process:** Must work within GitHub Actions limitations
- **CDN Compatibility:** Components must work with GitHub Pages CDN
- **Client-Side Processing:** All dynamic functionality must be client-side

### Component Architecture
- **Modular Design:** Components must be independently loadable
- **Base Component Class:** All components extend common BaseComponent
- **Event System:** Components communicate via events, not direct coupling
- **Progressive Loading:** Components can be loaded on-demand

## Security & Accessibility

### Accessibility Requirements
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance** for all new components
- **Screen Reader Support** for all interactive elements
- **Keyboard Navigation** for all functionality
- **High Contrast Mode** support
- **Reduced Motion** respect for user preferences

### Security Considerations
- **No Sensitive Data:** No personal information beyond what's already public
- **Client-Side Only:** All processing happens in browser
- **Safe External Resources:** Only load from trusted CDNs if needed
- **CSP Compatible:** Code must work with Content Security Policy

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Testing Requirements
- **Cross-Browser Testing** on all supported browsers
- **Mobile Device Testing** on actual hardware
- **Performance Testing** across different connection speeds
- **Accessibility Testing** with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- **Legacy Compatibility Testing** to ensure no regressions
