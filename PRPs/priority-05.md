# PRP-05: Responsive Mobile Experience

## Executive Summary

**Priority:** Medium-High Impact (5 of 8)
**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 days
**Impact:** Medium-High - Makes genealogy research accessible on mobile devices where users increasingly conduct research

The current AuntieRuth.com modernization focuses primarily on desktop experience, but genealogy research increasingly happens on mobile devices during family gatherings, cemetery visits, and travel. The 11,120+ legacy person pages use table-based layouts that break on mobile, images overflow screens, and navigation becomes unusable on touch devices.

## Background & Context

### Mobile Genealogy Research Context
Mobile devices are increasingly important for genealogy research:
- **Family Gatherings:** Sharing family history during reunions and visits
- **Cemetery Research:** Looking up information while visiting gravesites
- **Travel Research:** Accessing family information while visiting ancestral locations
- **Photo Sharing:** Comparing historical photos with current family members
- **Quick Reference:** Accessing birth dates, relationships during conversations

### Current Mobile Issues
The existing site has significant mobile usability problems:
- **Table Overflow:** Person detail tables scroll horizontally, breaking layout
- **Image Scaling:** Historical photos don't scale properly on mobile screens
- **Touch Targets:** Links and buttons too small for finger navigation
- **Navigation Breakdown:** Desktop navigation doesn't work on mobile
- **Text Readability:** Font sizes too small on mobile devices

## Current State Analysis

### Critical Mobile UX Issues

#### 1. Legacy Page Layout Problems
- **Table-based Person Pages:** XF*.htm files use fixed tables that break on mobile
- **Image Overflow:** Historical photos exceed screen width
- **Fixed Font Sizes:** 10pt text unreadable on mobile devices
- **Desktop-centric Navigation:** Header navigation unusable on touch devices

#### 2. Modern Component Mobile Issues
- **Family Tree Interaction:** Tree visualization needs touch gestures
- **Search Interface:** Advanced filters need mobile-optimized controls
- **Relationship Navigator:** Sidebar and tools need mobile layouts
- **Navigation Component:** Mobile menu implementation needed

#### 3. Touch Interaction Problems
- **Tap Targets:** Many links smaller than 44px minimum touch target
- **Gesture Support:** No swipe navigation between family members
- **Zoom Controls:** Family tree and image viewing need pinch-zoom support
- **Form Controls:** Search and filter inputs not optimized for mobile

### Mobile-First Opportunities
1. **Gesture-based Navigation:** Swipe between family members, photos
2. **Quick Actions:** Touch-and-hold for context menus
3. **Voice Search:** Speech-to-text for genealogy searches
4. **Camera Integration:** Photo comparison with historical images
