# PRP-07: Progressive Information Disclosure

## Executive Summary

**Priority:** Medium Impact (7 of 8)
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days
**Impact:** Medium - Improves information digestibility and user experience across all genealogy content

The current AuntieRuth.com person pages display all available information simultaneously in dense table formats, overwhelming users with extensive family details, biographical information, and relationship data. This information density makes it difficult for users to focus on relevant details and creates poor user experience, especially on mobile devices.

## Background & Context

### Prerequisites - Required Reading
Before starting this PRP, read:
- `../docs/README.md` - Understanding genealogy file naming conventions and directory structure
- `docs/new/CLAUDE.md` - Architecture and development guidelines for the modernization project
- `../PLAN/site-architecture.md` - Core site structure and data organization
- `../PLAN/technical-requirements.md` - Technical constraints and browser support
- `../PLAN/component-architecture.md` - Component patterns and base classes
- `../PLAN/mobile-responsive-design.md` - Mobile-first design principles and patterns
- `PRPs/priority-01.md` - Navigation improvements providing foundation
- `PRPs/priority-05.md` - Mobile-responsive design requiring information hierarchy

### Current Information Density Problems
Person pages (XF*.htm files) typically contain:
- **Basic Demographics:** Birth/death dates, locations, ages
- **Family Relationships:** Parents, spouse(s), children, siblings
- **Biographical Details:** Occupation, addresses, life events
- **Photo References:** Links to thumbnail galleries and individual images
- **Extended Family:** Cross-references to related family pages across lineages
- **Historical Context:** Location and temporal information

### Information Hierarchy Challenges
1. **No Information Priority:** All details given equal visual weight
2. **Overwhelming First Impression:** Users see everything at once
3. **Mobile Usability:** Dense tables create poor mobile experience
4. **Scan-ability Issues:** Hard to quickly find specific information
5. **Research Workflow Disruption:** Too much detail interrupts genealogy research flow

## Current State Analysis

### Information Display Issues

#### 1. Dense Table Layout Problems
- **Vertical Tables:** All information displayed in single table format
- **Equal Visual Weight:** Birth dates and addresses have same prominence
- **No Grouping:** Related information not visually grouped
- **Poor Scanning:** Difficult to quickly identify key information

#### 2. User Experience Impact
- **Cognitive Overload:** Too much information displayed simultaneously
- **Mobile Breakdown:** Table layouts unusable on mobile devices
- **Research Inefficiency:** Users must scan through irrelevant details
- **Context Loss:** Important information buried in details

#### 3. Information Prioritization Needs
- **Essential Information:** Name, birth/death dates, immediate family
- **Secondary Details:** Extended family, biographical details, addresses
- **Research Information:** Cross-references, photo links, lineage connections
- **Contextual Information:** Historical context, location details, notes

## Proposed Solution

### Progressive Information Disclosure Strategy
Implement an information hierarchy system that presents essential information first and allows users to progressively access additional details based on their research needs.

### Core Information Disclosure Features

#### 1. Information Hierarchy System
- **Essential Information First:** Name, life span, immediate family prominently displayed
- **Secondary Information Expandable:** Biographical details in collapsible sections
- **Research Information On-Demand:** Extended family and cross-references in dedicated sections
- **Contextual Information Available:** Historical context and detailed notes accessible when needed

#### 2. Interactive Information Panels
- **Expandable Sections:** Click to reveal additional information categories
- **Tabbed Interface:** Organize information into logical categories (Family, Biography, Photos, Research)
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Works without JavaScript, enhanced with interactivity
- **User Preference Memory:** Remember user's preferred information display settings

#### 3. Smart Information Prioritization
- **Research Context Awareness:** Highlight information relevant to current research context
- **Relationship-Based Disclosure:** Show family information relevant to relationship navigator
- **Search Context Integration:** Highlight information matching user's search queries
- **Timeline Context:** Emphasize temporal information when accessed from timeline views

#### 4. Mobile-Optimized Information Display
- **Card-Based Layout:** Replace dense tables with scannable information cards
- **Swipeable Information:** Touch gestures to navigate between information categories
- **Collapsible Details:** Touch-friendly expand/collapse for detailed information
- **Quick Information Access:** Essential information always visible on mobile
