# PRP-06: Add Timeline View

## Executive Summary

**Priority:** Medium Impact (6 of 8)
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days
**Impact:** Medium - Provides chronological context essential for historical family research

AuntieRuth.com contains birth and death dates for 2,985+ people spanning over 150 years of family history, but offers no chronological view of family events. Users cannot visualize family timelines, understand historical context, or explore how family events relate to historical periods, limiting the site's value for genealogical research and family storytelling.

## Background & Context

### Prerequisites - Required Reading
Before starting this PRP, read:
- `../docs/README.md` - Understanding genealogy file naming conventions and directory structure
- `docs/new/CLAUDE.md` - Architecture and development guidelines for the modernization project
- `../PLAN/site-architecture.md` - Core site structure and data organization
- `../PLAN/technical-requirements.md` - Technical constraints and browser support
- `../PLAN/component-architecture.md` - Component patterns and base classes
- `../PLAN/component-integration-patterns.md` - Inter-component communication patterns
- `PRPs/priority-01.md` - Navigation improvements for timeline integration
- `PRPs/priority-02.md` - Family tree component providing relationship context
- `PRPs/priority-03.md` - Search functionality for date-based queries
- `PRPs/priority-05.md` - Mobile-responsive design requirements

### Chronological Data Richness
The genealogy database contains extensive temporal data:
- **Birth/Death Dates:** Detailed dates from 1800s to present
- **Geographic Locations:** Birth and death locations showing migration patterns
- **Life Spans:** Age at death and life duration information
- **Family Events:** Marriage dates, children births creating family timelines
- **Historical Context:** Events spanning major historical periods (wars, immigration waves, economic changes)

### Timeline Research Value
Chronological views enable:
- **Historical Context:** Understanding family events within historical periods
- **Migration Patterns:** Visualizing family movement over time and geography
- **Generation Analysis:** Comparing life spans and patterns across generations
- **Family Stories:** Creating narratives around temporal family connections
- **Research Validation:** Cross-referencing family events with historical records

## Current State Analysis

### Missing Chronological Capabilities
1. **No Timeline Visualization:** Users cannot see family events in chronological order
2. **No Historical Context:** Family events lack historical period context
3. **No Generation Comparison:** Cannot compare life patterns across family generations
4. **No Migration Visualization:** Birth/death locations not shown chronologically
5. **No Family Event Clustering:** Related family events not grouped by time periods

### Research Scenarios Requiring Timeline View
1. **Family History Narrative:** "Show me the Nelson family story chronologically"
2. **Migration Research:** "When did the family move from Sweden to Canada?"
3. **Generation Analysis:** "Compare lifespans between grandparents and parents generation"
4. **Historical Context:** "What was happening historically when great-grandfather was born?"
5. **Event Clustering:** "Show all family births and deaths during the 1940s"

## Proposed Solution

### Interactive Timeline Component
Create a comprehensive `TimelineComponent` that visualizes family events chronologically with historical context, geographic information, and interactive exploration capabilities.

### Core Timeline Features

#### 1. Family Event Timeline

- **Event Clustering:** Group related family events by time periods
- **Life Span Visualization:** Show individual lifespans as bars on timeline

#### 2. Historical Context Integration
- **Historical Period Markers:** Show major historical events (wars, economic events, immigration waves)
- **Generational Context:** Highlight events affecting entire generations
- **Regional History:** Include location-specific historical context for birth/death locations
- **Timeline Zoom Levels:** Decade view, year view, and detailed date view

#### 3. Geographic Timeline Integration
- **Migration Timeline:** Show family movement patterns over time
- **Location-based Events:** Group events by geographic regions
- **Birth/Death Location Mapping:** Visualize geographic distribution over time
- **Immigration Timeline:** Track family immigration and settlement patterns

#### 4. Interactive Timeline Navigation
- **Zoom and Pan:** Navigate through different time periods and zoom levels
- **Event Details:** Click events for detailed person information
- **Family Story Mode:** Guided chronological tour of family history
- **Timeline Bookmarks:** Save and share specific timeline views
