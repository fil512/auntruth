# PRP-04: Create Relationship Navigator

## Executive Summary

**Priority:** Medium-High Impact (4 of 8)
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days
**Impact:** Medium-High - Enables intuitive family relationship exploration and discovery

While AuntieRuth.com contains detailed family relationship data for 2,985+ people across 10 lineages, users currently have no easy way to explore or understand how family members are related to each other. The site lacks relationship path finding, quick family navigation, and contextual relationship information that would help users understand complex genealogical connections.

## Background & Context

### Prerequisites - Required Reading
Before starting this PRP, read:
- `../docs/README.md` - Understanding genealogy file naming conventions and directory structure
- `docs/new/CLAUDE.md` - Architecture and development guidelines for the modernization project
- `../PLAN/site-architecture.md` - Core site structure and data organization
- `../PLAN/technical-requirements.md` - Technical constraints and browser support
- `../PLAN/component-architecture.md` - Component patterns and base classes
- `../PLAN/component-integration-patterns.md` - Inter-component communication patterns
- `PRPs/priority-01.md` - Navigation improvements providing integration foundation
- `PRPs/priority-02.md` - Family tree component providing relationship data structures
- `PRPs/priority-03.md` - Enhanced search providing relationship-based queries

### Genealogy Relationship Complexity
The AuntieRuth.com database contains complex family relationships:
- **Cross-lineage marriages:** People from different lineages marrying (e.g., L1 + L3)
- **Multiple generations:** Relationships spanning great-grandparents to great-grandchildren
- **Multiple marriages:** Many people have 2+ spouses over their lifetime
- **Adoption patterns:** Both biological and adopted family relationships
- **Regional connections:** Family members spread across different geographic locations

### Current Relationship Data Structure
Each person record contains direct relationship references:
```json
{
  "father": "Walter Arnold Hagborg [Hagborg-Hansson]",
  "mother": "Mary Irene Pringle-Hagborg [Pringle-Hambley]",
  "spouse": "Ruth Ann Nelson-Hagborg [Nelson]",
  "spouse2": "",
  "spouse3": "",
  "spouse4": ""
}
```

## Current State Analysis

### Missing Relationship Capabilities
1. **No Path Finding:** Users can't discover "How are Person A and Person B related?"
2. **No Relationship Context:** When viewing a person, no indication of how they relate to previously viewed people
3. **No Quick Family Navigation:** Must click through multiple pages to explore immediate family
4. **No Relationship Visualization:** Cannot see relationship paths or family connection patterns
5. **No Relationship History:** No tracking of relationship exploration for research context

### Genealogy Research Scenarios
1. **Relationship Discovery:** "How is David Hagborg related to Mary Nelson?"
2. **Family Context:** "Show me all the ways these two family branches connect"
3. **Generation Analysis:** "Who are all the 3rd cousins of this person?"
4. **Marriage Connections:** "How did the Hagborg and Nelson families first connect?"
5. **Research Context:** "I was looking at Person A, now I'm at Person B - how are they related?"

## Proposed Solution

### Relationship Navigator Component
Create a new `RelationshipNavigator` component that provides intelligent relationship path finding, quick family navigation, and contextual relationship information throughout the site.

### Core Features

#### 1. Relationship Path Finder
- **"How Are We Related?" Tool:** Find and display relationship paths between any two people
- **Multiple Path Detection:** Show all possible relationship connections (e.g., both cousin via father's side and great-niece via mother's side)
- **Relationship Strength:** Indicate closeness (immediate family, cousins, distant relations)
- **Cross-lineage Paths:** Handle relationships spanning multiple family lineages

#### 2. Contextual Family Sidebar
- **Always-visible Family Context:** Floating sidebar showing immediate family of current person
- **Quick Navigation:** One-click access to parents, spouse(s), children, siblings
- **Relationship Indicators:** Show how current person relates to recently viewed people
- **Family Branch Context:** Indicate which lineage/branch user is currently exploring

#### 3. Smart Relationship Suggestions
- **Related People Recommendations:** "You might also be interested in..." based on relationship patterns
- **Family Discovery:** Suggest exploring related family branches or generations
- **Connection Insights:** Highlight interesting relationship patterns or family connections
- **Research Trail:** Show relationship context for genealogy research workflows

#### 4. Relationship Visualization
- **Relationship Path Diagrams:** Visual representation of how two people are related
- **Family Connection Maps:** Show all connection points between family branches
- **Generation Charts:** Visual representation of generational relationships
- **Marriage Connection Networks:** Show how families connect through marriage
