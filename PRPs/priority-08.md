# PRP-08: Improve URL Structure & Routing

## Executive Summary

**Priority:** Low-Medium Impact (8 of 8)
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days
**Impact:** Low-Medium - Improves SEO, user experience, and modern web standards while maintaining compatibility

The current AuntieRuth.com URL structure uses complex genealogy-specific paths like `/auntruth/new/htm/L1/XF191.htm` that are difficult to remember, share, and understand. While functionally adequate, these URLs don't reflect modern web standards, create poor SEO opportunities, and provide no intuitive navigation hints for users exploring family relationships.

## Background & Context

### Prerequisites - Required Reading
Before starting this PRP, read:
- `../docs/README.md` - Understanding genealogy file naming conventions and directory structure
- `docs/new/CLAUDE.md` - Architecture and development guidelines for the modernization project
- `../PLAN/site-architecture.md` - Core site structure and data organization
- `../PLAN/technical-requirements.md` - Technical constraints and browser support
- `../PLAN/component-architecture.md` - Component patterns and base classes
- `../PLAN/component-integration-patterns.md` - Inter-component communication patterns
- All previous PRPs (01-07) - URL routing must support all enhanced features

### Current URL Structure Complexity
The existing genealogy URL pattern:
- **Person Pages:** `/auntruth/new/htm/L1/XF191.htm`
- **Photo Pages:** `/auntruth/new/htm/L1/XI2717.htm`
- **Thumbnail Pages:** `/auntruth/new/htm/L1/THF191.htm`
- **Lineage Indexes:** `/auntruth/new/htm/L1/index.htm`

### URL Structure Challenges
1. **Non-Intuitive Paths:** Technical genealogy codes (XF, XI, THF) meaningless to users
2. **Poor SEO:** URLs don't contain searchable keywords or person names
3. **Difficult Sharing:** Complex URLs difficult to remember and share verbally
4. **No Context Hints:** URLs provide no indication of content or relationships
5. **Maintenance Burden:** Manual URL construction for 11,120+ pages

## Current State Analysis

### URL Usability Issues

#### 1. User Experience Problems
- **Memorability:** URLs like `/htm/L1/XF191.htm` impossible to remember
- **Shareability:** Complex technical URLs discourage social sharing
- **Context Loss:** URLs don't indicate person name, lineage, or content type
- **Navigation Confusion:** No URL-based navigation hints for users

#### 2. SEO and Discoverability Issues
- **Search Engine Optimization:** URLs contain no searchable keywords
- **Content Understanding:** Search engines can't understand page content from URL
- **Link Value:** External links have no semantic value due to technical URLs
- **Social Media:** Poor URL preview generation for social sharing

#### 3. Modern Web Standards Gap
- **RESTful Design:** URLs don't follow REST conventions for resource identification
- **Semantic URLs:** No semantic meaning in URL structure
- **URL Routing:** No modern client-side routing for single-page application features
- **Deep Linking:** Poor support for linking to specific features or states

## Proposed Solution

### Modern URL Structure with Legacy Compatibility
Implement a dual URL system that provides user-friendly URLs while maintaining complete backward compatibility with existing genealogy URLs.

### Enhanced URL Structure Design

#### 1. User-Friendly URL Patterns
- **Person Pages:** `/person/david-hagborg` or `/person/david-hagborg-191`
- **Family Pages:** `/family/hagborg-hansson` or `/lineage/hagborg-hansson`
- **Photos:** `/person/david-hagborg/photos` or `/photo/early-morning-2717`
- **Search:** `/search/nelson?birth=1940-1950&lineage=2`
- **Timeline:** `/timeline/1940-1950?lineage=hagborg-hansson`

#### 2. Client-Side URL Routing
- **Single Page Application Features:** URL routing for family tree, timeline, search states
- **State Preservation:** URLs preserve application state (search filters, timeline position, family tree focus)
- **Deep Linking:** Direct linking to specific family tree views, search results, timeline periods
- **History Management:** Browser back/forward navigation works with application states

#### 3. Legacy URL Preservation
- **Automatic Redirects:** All existing URLs redirect to new friendly URLs
- **Canonical URLs:** Legacy URLs remain functional with canonical tag pointing to new URLs
- **Sitemap Management:** Generate sitemaps with both old and new URL structures
- **External Link Protection:** Existing bookmarks and external links continue working

#### 4. SEO and Metadata Enhancement
- **Semantic URLs:** URLs contain person names, lineage names, and content descriptors
- **Metadata Integration:** Enhanced meta tags and structured data based on URL content
- **Social Media Optimization:** Improved URL previews for social sharing
- **Search Engine Indexing:** Better search engine understanding of genealogy content
