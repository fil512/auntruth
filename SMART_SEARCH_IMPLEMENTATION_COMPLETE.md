# Data structure validation
python3 -c "import json; data=json.load(open('docs/new/js/data.json')); print(f'Loaded {len(data[\"people\"])} people')"
# Result: ✅ Loaded 2985 people successfully

# File structure verification
ls -la docs/new/js/components/enhanced-search.js docs/new/js/components/search-export.js docs/new/css/enhanced-search.css
