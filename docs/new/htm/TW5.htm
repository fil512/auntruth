                    In 1945 Arthur and wife Dorothy took over the dairy from August Selch. In 1948 they started using a milking machine powered by a gasoline motor. In 1952 when electric power became available the machine was converted to an electric unit. August Arthur sold the dairy herd in 1963.
Sept 1 2002 - whilst visiting Beausejour Cemetery, Dave Hagborg was pushing Art in a wheelchair. The ground was rough and the chair almost upset. Art said 'Hey, Dave, you have to dig the hole first before you throw me out!"

                    Was one of the founders of St. Paul's Lutheran Church in Green Bay, MB 1898. Married Amalia Weise 04/20/1900 who arrived from Europe. They met and were married in Winnipeg by Pastor F. Beer. In 1917 they moved to a farm on the east side of Beausejour, but the Green Bay property was kept for grain. They started a dairy business in 1928. Initially all the cows were milked by hand, and the milk, in 8 gallon cans had to be hauled by horse-drawn wagon to the railway station in Beausejour, to be shipped to Winnipeg. By 1935 the milk was picked up by a transfer truck and hauled to the city. August Selch was the first to own a cream separator.
