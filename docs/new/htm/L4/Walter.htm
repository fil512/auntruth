                In 1869 the south side of the chancel was entirely rebuilt, leaving, however,
the tower and chancel as they have stood for many generations. The church is a
perpetual curacy, and the present Patron is William Thomas, St. Quinton, Esq.

                The following are such notices of tile Lowthorpes of this parish and its near
vicinity as I could glean during my English search:

                1216. WALTER DE LOWTHORPE, elected sheriff for Yorkshire.

            <p>
                <br>
                1292. WALTER DE LOWTHORPE is summoned to answer to the king, Edward I, for
attempting to regulate the "assize of beer" on all of his tenants in
Lowthorpe and other places without a license from the king. He stoutly defended
himself, insisting upon his unquestioned right "anent custom thro his
ancestors without interruption, beyond the memory of man."

                <br>
                1287. ROBERT and RICHARD LOWTHORP, of Whepsted,Thingoe
hundred, Suffolk, were licensed May 6th, 16th Edward I (1287) by the crown at
the gate of St. Edmunds to give to the Abbot in Mortmain eighty-seven acres of
land, five acres of meadow and twelve acres of wood, in Whepsted, for the
support of certain chaplains celebrating daily in the Chapel of St. John. The
above lands they had purchased of Peter de Bradfeld and his Wife Agnes, and of
William Mitchell. Gage's Suffolk, p. 397.

                1317. ROBERT DE LOUTHORP is presented by the Abbey of St. Edmunds to the
rectorship of Horningsheath. Ibid., 523.

                1392. At the death of ROBERT LOWTHROP an inquisition was held regarding certain
tenements in Beverley which he had given to the Church of St. John in that
town, the revenues from which were to be appropriated for masses by the
chaplains there, for the repose of his soul.

Sywardley, Esq., of Sywardley, April 9, 1450. Surtes Soc. Vol 2

                1474. Aug. 3, ROBERT LOWTHORP, of Bridlington, makes his will, which was proved
at York on the 3d of the following November. He gives his landed estate to his
relatives at Lowthorpe and Cherry Burton. The will gives us the name of his
wife, Catherine who was also his executrix. This will is printed as
illustrating the position and character of the man, and as no children are
named, as suggesting that he left no other family than his wife. This is also
noteworthy as being the earliest will now preserved in the registry at York of
any person of the name Lowthorp.

                It is written in the abbreviated Latin peculiar to that period. The following
is the translation:

                "In the name of God, Amen, the third day of the month of August, fourteen
hundred and seventy-four. I Robert Lowthrope, of Bridlington, being of sound
mind and memory make my testament in this manner.
