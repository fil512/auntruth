- never chmod python scripts. just execute them as an argument to python3

## CRITICAL: NO BACKUP FILES EVER
**NEVER CREATE BACKUP FILES (.backup, .bak, .orig, etc.) WHEN USING GIT**
- We are in a git repository - git IS our backup system
- Creating .backup files is redundant, wasteful, and creates clutter
- Any script that creates backup files must be immediately fixed
- If you need to preserve state, commit to git first, then make changes
- If a script fails, use `git checkout` to revert changes
- REMOVE any existing backup files immediately upon discovery

## Python Script Guidelines

### Before Writing New Scripts
1. **ALWAYS read docs/README.md first** to understand the file naming conventions and directory structure
2. **ALWAYS read PRPs/scripts/README.md first** to check if an existing script can be reused
3. Check the organized subdirectories:
   - `PRPs/scripts/htm/` - scripts for docs/htm directory
   - `PRPs/scripts/new/` - scripts for docs/new directory
   - `PRPs/scripts/both/` - scripts that work with either directory

### When Writing New Python Scripts
- Place scripts in the appropriate subdirectory based on their target:
  - **htm/** - if script works only with docs/htm
  - **new/** - if script works only with docs/new
  - **both/** - if script can work with either directory or has options for both
- Follow the safety protocols and templates documented in PRPs/scripts/README.md
- Update PRPs/scripts/README.md with documentation for any new script
- Never run the link checker yourself. Always ask me to do it.

### Integration Status

**Components are BUILT but NOT INTEGRATED into web pages yet.**

To activate Phase 3 features on any HTML page:

1. **Add the data attribute:**
   ```html
   <body data-phase3-enabled>
   ```

2. **Include the integration script:**
   ```html
   <script type="module" src="docs/new/js/phase3-integration.js"></script>
   ```

3. **Include the CSS:**
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="docs/new/css/phase3-components.css">
   ```

### Validation Results

- **✅ Relationship Graph Testing:** Graph built for 775 people, all path-finding tests passed
- **✅ Date Parsing Testing:** 36/36 test cases passed (100% success rate)
- **✅ URL Routing Testing:** 25/26 tests passed (96.2% success rate)
- **✅ Integration Testing:** All architecture compliance checks passed
- **✅ Performance:** All metrics met (< 100ms relationships, < 500ms timeline, < 50ms routing)

### User Experience Features

- **Relationship Navigator:** Fixed sidebar showing family context with immediate family
- **Timeline Exploration:** Interactive chronological view with historical events
- **Modern URLs:** Clean, SEO-friendly URLs with legacy compatibility
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Ctrl+R (relationships), Ctrl+T (timeline)

### Next Steps for Live Integration

1. **Choose target pages** for Phase 3 activation (recommend starting with main index pages)
2. **Add integration code** to selected HTML files
3. **Test on staging** before production deployment
4. **Monitor performance** and user feedback
5. **Complete relationship finder modal** implementation (optional enhancement)
